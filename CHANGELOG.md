# Version 0.6.0 (2025-08-11)

## Breaking Change

- Improve completion filtering with before/after context:

  to require the AI to combine information from before and after the cursor to
  generate the correct logic.

  and provide clearer instructions to the AI on handling various completion
  scenarios like code, comments, and strings.
